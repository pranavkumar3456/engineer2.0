# Week 1 – Plan (In Progress)

I'm currently working through Week 1 of my transformation journey. This week is all about:

- ✅ Learning Go basics
- ✅ Writing a small CLI tool
- ✅ Setting up CI/CD for the Go app
- ✅ Exploring MLOps (MLflow/Kubeflow video)
- ✅ Running a simple Spring Boot app

I'll update this file with what I complete + reflections as I go.
